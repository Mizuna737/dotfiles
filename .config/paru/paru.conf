# ~/.config/paru/paru.conf
# See paru.conf(5) for full option list.
#

[options]
# Use your main pacman config (color, parallel downloads, etc.):
PacmanConf = /etc/pacman.conf

# ---- Speed vs noise tuning ----

# Don’t prompt you to review PKGBUILDs every time.
# You can still review with `paru -G pkgname`.
SkipReview

# Show search results from bottom to top (most relevant at bottom),
# which also keeps interactive output compact.
BottomUp

# Don’t run check() or pull checkdepends – speeds up builds.
# (Turn this off if you rely on package test suites.)
NoCheck

# Remove untracked build files after install (keeps cache tidy).
CleanAfter

# Don’t do devel/VCS updates automatically on -Syu (faster).
# Run `paru -Syu --devel` when you actually want them.
# (Leaving this *unset* means “off”, so this line is only for clarity.)
# Devel

# Limit search result length (less scrolling noise).
Limit = 50

# Don’t fetch PKGBUILDs again if they’re already cached,
# and don’t force rebuilds; both keep things snappy.
# (These are *off* by default, so we just leave them out.)

# Don’t print Arch news automatically; leave NewsOnUpgrade disabled.
# (It’s off by default if not present.)

# Likewise, leave UpgradeMenu disabled for simpler output.

# Example extras you *might* want later (commented out):
# Provides       # smarter provider resolution, slightly more chatter
# CombinedUpgrade  # fancy combined repo+AUR menu
# NewsOnUpgrade    # print Arch news during -Syu
# UpgradeMenu      # detailed upgrade list like pacman VerbosePkgLists

[bin]
# Stick to system defaults. Add things here only if you want to override.
# Example: use bat for colored PKGBUILD review later:
# Bat = /usr/bin/bat
# Pager = /usr/bin/less
